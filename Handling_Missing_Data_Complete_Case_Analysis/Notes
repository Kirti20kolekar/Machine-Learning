Complete Case Analysis (CCA) is a straightforward and commonly used method to handle missing data. This method, also known as listwise deletion, involves excluding any rows in the dataset that contain missing values. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of CCA

Overview of Complete Case Analysis
Definition Complete Case Analysis removes any data rows that have at least one missing value, leaving only those rows that are complete (i.e., without any missing data) for analysis.
Usage Ideal when the dataset is large and the amount of missing data is relatively small.

When to Use Complete Case Analysis
Data Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) CCA is most effective if the missing data points are random and not influenced by other observed or unobserved data.
Minimal Loss of Data It works well when only a small percentage of the dataset is missing data, ensuring the loss of information is negligible.
Simplicity CCA is easy to implement and does not require complex imputation or estimation techniques.

Steps in Implementing Complete Case Analysis
Identify Missing Values Use functions to detect missing values in the dataset.
Exclude Rows with Missing Data Filter out rows where any column has a missing value.
Perform Analysis on Complete Cases Only Proceed with your statistical analysis or model training using only the complete rows.

Advantages of Complete Case Analysis
Simple to Implement Requires minimal computational effort and no additional imputation.
Bias Minimization Works well in situations where missing data is MCAR, as this helps to avoid biases.
Disadvantages of Complete Case Analysis
Data Loss Excluding rows with missing data can significantly reduce the dataset size, especially if missing data is extensive.
Potential Bias If data is missing not at random (MNAR) or even at random (MAR), CCA can lead to biased results.
